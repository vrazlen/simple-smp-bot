# Free 24/7 Hosting Guide (No Credit Card)

Since Serv00/CT8 are full and Glitch is dead, here are the **Final Free Options** for 2025.

## Option 1: Wispbyte / HidenCloud (Community Hosts)
These are "Community Hosts" that offer free slots. They are your best bet for cloud hosting.
1.  **Wispbyte**: [wispbyte.com](https://wispbyte.com) - Offers free Discord/Bot hosting.
2.  **HidenCloud**: [hidencloud.com](https://hidencloud.com) - Offers free "Always On" servers (requires weekly renewal click).
    - **How to use**: Join their Discord or sign up on their site. Claim a free server. Upload your files via their panel.

## Option 2: Self-Hosting (Your Laptop - 100% Reliable)
If you cannot find a free host, the **only** guaranteed way is to run it yourself.
1.  **Keep your laptop on**.
2.  **Turn off the screen** (Power Settings -> "When plugged in, turn off screen after..." -> "Never sleep").
3.  **Run the bot**:
    ```bash
    node bot.js mc.noverencia.fun vrazlen offline 22300607
    ```
4.  **Minimize the terminal**.
    *This costs $0 and works perfectly.*

## Option 3: Old Android Phone (Termux)
If you have an old phone lying around:
1.  Install **Termux** (F-Droid).
2.  Run: `pkg install nodejs`
3.  Transfer files and run `node bot.js`.
